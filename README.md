Project made by Tiffany Garcia

Project Idea:
Goal is to demonstrate how password cracking is an issue today since constant data breaches leave us at risk. I will also add some mitigations and how to monitor the traffic from attempts trying to login.

Setup:
The project setup is not yet completed. I still need to add the hashcat software, password list data, and other files I might need to simulate my attack using the 2 containers I have built.

User1: Victim to data breach and password hash has been compromised.
Attacker: Has most commonly used passwords list and hash of user1. Will attempt to use that information to gain root access in the container.

Security Solution is to add monitoring and possible limit the attempts of login attempts.
